          <p><span class="l-fontsize">S</span>ince Europeans began colonizing North America, relations with the Native Americans have been tense. Marked by death, treaty violations, and forced migration, Native Americans have had to face many trials and tribulations. Today, they occupy a minuscule area of land in comparison to what they were promised.
        </p>
        <p class="py-small"><a href="https://friendsofpineridgereservation.org/about-pine-ridge-reservation-and-foprr/statistics-about-pine-ridge-reservation/" target="_blank" class="underline" >The Pine Ridge Reservation</a> is a prime example of what has resulted from the conflict between Native Americans and the United States. 97% of its population lives below the poverty line of the United States, and more than a third of its homes don’t have access to water and electricity.</p>
       
        <p class="py-small">The first treaty that was broken by the United States was the <a href="https://www.ndstudies.gov/gr8/content/unit-iii-waves-development-1861-1920/lesson-4-alliances-and-conflicts/topic-2-sitting-bulls-people/section-3-treaties-fort-laramie-1851-1868" target="_blank" class="underline" >Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851</a>, which set clear boundaries for the Lakota Sioux nation and prevented U.S. citizens from causing any harm to the Lakota. However, there wasn’t a clear line of communication between the Natives and the U.S., and a consensus wasn’t reached within the Natives, a requirement whenever they made decisions.</p>
        <p class="py-small">The next decade had increased tensions between the United States and the Lakota. The Homestead Act of 1862 and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad led to much of the land that was set aside for the Lakota being taken away. Many skirmishes occurred between the U.S. army and the Lakota. <a href="https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/sioux-treaty" target="_blank" class="underline" >The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868</a>, which set aside the Black Hills to only be used by the Lakota Sioux, was broken in 1874 as gold miners moved in with aid from the U.S. Army. The Black Hills were finally confiscated from the Lakota in 1877.</p>
        <p class="py-small">The final clash between the Sioux and the United States occurred during 1890 at <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/native-american-history/wounded-knee" target="_blank" class="underline" >Wounded Knee</a>. It is unclear who started the battle, but it is clear that the United States army was victorious, having only 25 casualties whereas the Lakota had 150. This was the turning point of what had become a war between the Lakota and the United States.

          </p>
          
        <p class="py-small">The Pine Ridge Reservation, created in 1889, served as land intended for prisoners of war. To this day, they are far behind the standards of the rest of the country. From a lack of basic needs to widespread poverty, people living in Pine Ridge are disadvantaged economically and don’t have access to the same opportunities as most other areas in developed countries do.</p>
        <p class="py-small">Poverty and unemployment have resulted in widespread alcoholism and health issues. Diseases such as diabetes, tuberculosis, and even cancer are much more widespread than they are throughout the rest of the nation. The average life expectancy is 48 years for men and 52 years for women. Due to alcoholism, many children are born with fetal alcohol syndrome, causing irreversible setbacks in growth and development.</p>
        <p class="py-small">Lakota activists attempt to end the alcoholism crisis on their land. A small town known as Whiteclay is responsible for selling over ten thousand cans of beer a day. In 2013, protestors attempted to prevent trucks that were shipping beer cans into Whiteclay from entering, leading to the arrest of many people.</p>
        
        <p class="py-small">People that live on reservations have been forgotten by the general public and government officials alike. The general public survives off of food stamps and donations from nonprofit organizations. While campaigning and attempting to uphold a large array of promises, politicians forget to consider one of the poorest regions of the United States. This has led to a lack of participation in government elections on the Pine Ridge Reservation.

        </p>
        
        <p class="py-small">Due to these unstable conditions, children lack an environment that is necessary to foster educational growth. After being neglected and abused at home, children go to underfunded public schools and lack school supplies.</p>
        <p class="py-small">
          The boarding schools that the Lakota were forced to attend as their land was being encroached on led to a loss of cultural identity. Today, schools such as the Lakota Waldorf School are founded by Natives themselves to instill a sense of Native American cultural values within their children. Most teachers incorporate art into their lessons, and beading and archery are taught alongside math classes. To combat income issues, the <a href="https://www.indianz.com/News/2018/05/22/school-on-pine-ridge-reservation-immerse.asp" target="_blank" class="underline" >Lakota Waldorf Schoo</a>l is tuition-free and instead receives its funding from donors. Students are provided with three healthy meals a day.
        </p>
        <p class="py-small">
          The fact that the Lakota are still standing today shows their ability to survive as a nation. After centuries of mistreatment and abuse, the Lakota and other Native Americans across the continent have been forgotten and are being neglected by the overwhelming majority of people. It is ingrained in the tradition of Native Americans to look always look after each other, regardless of their situation.
